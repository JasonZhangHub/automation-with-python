# Automation with Python
Performing repetitive tasks can be boring. 

Think about your daily work and identify those that you think can be automated.

The repetitive taks can be 
* organsing files in folders, 
* combining multiple excel worksheet together
* sending regular standardized emails to clients, or
* filling information in webpage

Once you find a suitable task, you can think of ways to automate them by dividing into smaller tasks.

Luckily, we can leverage on a variety of tools to relieve us of tedious labor.
Python offers great readability and approachable syntax, which makes it an excellent choice to start your journey with.
You can automate nearly everything with Python. From sending emails to interacting with APIs.
